This code is an improvement on the Python version of TabNet, 
so continue to use its training frame structure, 
refer to https://github.com/dreamquark-ai/tabnet/tree/develop/pytorch_tabnet

It should be noted that the "n_independent" and "n_shared" in the abstract file of the original Tabnet need to be replaced with the number of links and layers!
